    Game cheetah is an utility to modifiy the state of a game process.

    Make yourself more memory, better stats or more lifes.

    Single player games store the game state in memory where multi player games
    don't. So, this utility is not useful for multiplayer games.
    
    Game Cheetah runs natively on Linux, Mac and Windows computers.
    
    Keep in mind that altering a game memory contents may lead to game and/or computer crashes. Use at your own risk.
